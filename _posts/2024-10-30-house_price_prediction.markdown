## Intro
{{ site.tabc }} From <span class="post-content-link"><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data" target="_blank">House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques</a></span> this dataset is target to predict a house price and we can specific this is regression problem. And will use XGBoost to predict house price.
