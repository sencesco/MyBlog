## Intro
{{ site.tabc }} In this project, I developed a deep learning model to predict dog breeds from images. With the increasing popularity of image classification tasks, this project focuses on building a robust classifier capable of distinguishing between 50 dog breeds using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). the actual dataset is 120 cloass but for faster training I decided to use 50 classes.

I used <span class="post-content-link"><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinehorng/dogbreedidfromcomp" target="_blank">Kaggle's Dog Breed Identification dataset</a></span>
for this challenge, and the model was built using TensorFlow/Keras.
